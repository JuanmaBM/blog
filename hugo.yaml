    title: "About Me"
    image: ""
    content: |-
      I am a software engineer with extensive experience in various fields such as software development, cloud computing, DevOps, system architecture design, and full-stack development. Throughout my career, I transitioned into more strategic roles, specializing as a microservices integration architect and solutions architect focused on cloud-based architectures. However, my passion for technology brought me back to my roots as a software engineer, where I returned to full technical specialization. The experience I’ve acquired over the years has helped me become highly adaptable and versatile in my role.

      I'm an avid reader who is always eager to learn something new or improve. I’m also constantly looking for ways to implement or develop ideas that allow me to apply what I learn through books or the internet.

      Outside of work, I practice mixed martial arts, am an avid reader of novels, a fan of great movies and I enjoy videogames with great stories—those made with passion, not just for profit. As a techie/nerd, I’m a strong advocate of Open Source, and I try to contribute to Open Source projects or write tech posts whenever I can.

          I work as a Software Engineer for the Hybrid Console Management (HCM) Engineering Productivity Team. This team is responsible for making the daily operations of other HCM teams more efficient. Some of my responsibilities include developing tools and applications that assist with deploying, monitoring, and testing HCM applications. These responsibilities require a broad knowledge of software development, including not only software development but also Kubernetes/OpenShift capabilities, QA/Testing, Monitoring/Logging, Cloud providers, and even ML/AI.

          Our solutions must adapt to each requirement and are designed to be robust and highly available. To achieve this, we use technologies like OpenShift, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and AWS.

          Our main tools and applications are written in Go and React, but we are open to using various languages and tools such as Python, Ansible, and Bash. Additionally, we need to be familiar with different CI/CD technologies like Jenkins, GitLab, and Tekton

          As a consultant at RedHat, my role is to help clients efficiently adopt RedHat technologies and streamline the development and maintenance of their applications, infrastructure, and platforms. A RedHat consultant is expected to recommend best practices when working with cloud technologies, Kubernetes, automation, and application development. This requires staying continuously updated on emerging technologies.

          Additionally, I have collaborated with the architecture team in delivering presentations and workshops to clients, aimed at showcasing and expanding the use of RedHat technologies.

          As a Solution Architect, I was involved in high-impact tasks across several projects. Some of these tasks included developing proofs of concept to evaluate the viability of proposed solutions, designing applications and platform systems to meet customer requirements for performance, security, and capacity. I also worked on complex application architectures using various tech stacks and approaches, such as event-driven, serverless, and streaming microservices architectures. During this period, I consistently utilized Kubernetes, ensuring that all applications and the designed platform adhered to cloud-native best practices.

          In addition to my technical role, I was responsible for enhancing team effectiveness. I served as a Team Lead, balancing both leadership and technical responsibilities.

          During this period I was involucrated in the evolution of some monolitic applications to microservices ecosystems and the migration to cloud native applications.
          I also was working with Kubernetes, Infraestucture-as-code or NoSQL databases. I started to concern about high level designs decissions as platform, infraestructure 
          or monitorization/observability, as well as application architecture. Also, I initiated my journey with automation tools as Ansible or Terraform.
